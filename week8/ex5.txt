The physical address is an address within a specific memory hardware component. The virtual address is the address within a layer of abstraction that spans one or more physical devices, it gives the programmer the illusion of having infinite memory available on their system.
Virtual addresses are typically larger than physical addresses.
It is the task of the operating system to map the virtual addresses to physical ones.
